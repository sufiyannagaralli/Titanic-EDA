# Titanic-EDA
Conducted an analysis of the Titanic dataset to understand the demographics of passengers who perished using Python, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. The project involved data cleaning (handling null values and duplicates) and feature engineering to enhance the dataset. Key findings revealed that women and high-class passengers had higher survival rates.
